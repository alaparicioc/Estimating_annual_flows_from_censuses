This repository contains data and code implement the methodology proposed in our paper. It contains three folders and the following files:

## **data**:

> `synthetic_data.csv`:
Synthetic dataset to be used as input data for the model. Data use copyrights prevents from sharing the original data used for the modelling. However the original data can be obtained from different sources (see `Data sources.pdf`). Here we provide a synthetic dataset which is similar in structure to the original dataset. 

> `Data sources.pdf`:
Document which list the sources of input data for estimating true migration flows. 



## **code**:

> `Rcode_creating_synthetic_data.R`:
R code to create the synthetic dataset in `synthetic_data.csv`.

> `JAGS_code_model.txt`:
Text file containing [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net) code to estimate models in Equations 5 and 6 of the main body.

> `Rcode_model.R`:
R code to run the JAGS code and obtain chains, summary statistics, Potential scale reduction factors (prfs) and Effective Sample Sizes (ESS) of parameters.



## **output**:

> `true_flows_estimates.csv`:
Our estimated true migration flows, which conform a dataset of 5610 observations and six variables (Origin, Destination, year, mean_trueflows, q2.5_trueflows, q97.5_trueflows).

In order to estimate true migration flows, one needs to create a working directory whit the files named `synthetic_data.csv`, `JAGS_code_model.txt` and `Rcode_model.R`. The last file calls the input data (`synthetic_data.csv`) and the code from JAGS (`JAGS_code_model.txt`).
